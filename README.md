## Why RDP Portal?

By default, Remote Desktop Connection (mstsc.exe) is not possible to backup the saved passwords and the connection management is not good. 

With RDP Portal, it is possible to save password and use it on any other Windows PCs.

## ⭐ Features
- Save Password
- Portable
- Backup-able
- The workflow is similar to WinSCP or HeidiSQL
